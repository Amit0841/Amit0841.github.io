Hi there! My name is Amit, and I'm a fresher Java developer. I'm passionate about coding and love working on new projects. I'm proficient in Java programming language and have experience in developing web applications using Spring framework.

I'm eager to learn more about software development and am constantly looking for new challenges to improve my skills. My goal is to become a skilled developer and contribute to the software development community.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading tech blogs, playing video games and watching sci-fi movies. Feel free to reach out to me for any coding related queries or just to say hi!
